# Introduction
TinySteel is a super lightweight framework which allows for developers to create micro or one-paged applications.

# Installation
To install the framework, youâ€™ll want to make sure that you have a web server with mod_rewrite and PHP 7. (Steel may run on older versions but is developed on PHP 7)

Download the latest version of TinySteel from https://github.com/EricRabil/tiny-steel/archive/master.zip and unzip it to wherever you want to store your web documents. Then, update your web server to make only the **public** directory available (make it your DocumentRoot)
